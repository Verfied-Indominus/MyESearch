PROJECT: MyESearch

TEAM: Shivan, Munesha and Trey

ABOUT

The purpose of our project, MyeSearch, is to create a platform specific to the University of the West Indies (UWI) that allows researchers and students to showcase their academic work and discover new areas of interest. MyeSearch aims to expose undergraduates to various research topics and provide postgraduates with a tool to guide their research and potentially find collaborators with aligned interests. The website enables users to perform quick searches on related topics, relevant publications, and researcher profiles in specific fields or for possible collaborations. Additionally, users can utilize advanced filtering options to narrow their results by faculty, department, publication type, year published, most recent, most cited, or alphabetically. MyeSearch aims to provide a convenient, easily accessible, and up-to-date website that also encourages communication between students and researchers, with the ultimate goal of fostering a larger research community.

FUTURE WORK

For the next iteration, there are a few major goals to be met:

Site Responsiveness
	
As this project was developed mainly for desktop devices, there were no inclusions of css media queries for different screen sizes to accommodate mobile devices. However, since a large portion of the world uses mainly mobile devices on a day-to-day basis, it would provide an edge to this project if it was accommodating to mobile platforms as well. Hence, a major goal for the next iteration is site responsiveness.
Citation Tree Generation
	
As this feature was deemed infeasible in this iteration, it is a major goal for the next, with the focus being the adoption of a better technology for interacting with Google Scholar which would provide consistently quicker query results. 

Chat Functionality

With the ultimate goal of this project being the building of a better research community within the university, there is a great importance placed on the need for discussion and communication between students and researchers. Not only to encourage students to be more interested in research as a way to improve themselves and as a career, but also to promote ease of access to existing research and higher chances of collaborations among researchers and students.

Upgrade Database

To ensure data longevity, the current database will need to be upgraded to a premium package so that the contained data will not expire when the three (3) month time limit is passed.

Change Architecture to Service-Oriented

As the number of users of this platform increase, so too would the need for scalability and flexibility so as to accommodate a high number of concurrent users without any noticeable decrease in performance and to allow for updates to be made without interfering with overall site availability.

Adjust Email Design

The last major goal for the next iteration would be to alter the current design of the email notifications to include html-generated elements for more aesthetically pleasing designs.
